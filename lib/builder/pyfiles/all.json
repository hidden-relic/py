Relevant event: [on_gui_checked_state_changed](on_gui_checked_state_changed)\n- `\"sprite\"`: An element that shows an image.\n- `\"scroll-pane\"`: An invisible element that is similar to a `flow`, but has the ability to show and use scroll bars.\n- `\"drop-down\"`: A drop-down containing strings of text. Relevant event: [on_gui_selection_state_changed](on_gui_selection_state_changed)\n- `\"list-box\"`: A list of strings, only one of which can be selected at a time. Shows a scroll bar if necessary. Relevant event: [on_gui_selection_state_changed](on_gui_selection_state_changed)\n- `\"camera\"`: A camera that shows the game at the given position on the given surface. It can visually track an [entity](LuaGuiElement::entity) that is set after the element has been created.\n- `\"choose-elem-button\"`: A button that lets the player pick from a certain kind of prototype, with optional filtering. Relevant event: [on_gui_elem_changed](on_gui_elem_changed)\n- `\"text-box\"`: A multi-line `textfield`. Relevant event: [on_gui_text_changed](on_gui_text_changed)\n- `\"slider\"`: A horizontal number line which can be used to choose a number. Relevant event: [on_gui_value_changed](on_gui_value_changed)\n- `\"minimap\"`: A minimap preview, similar to the normal player minimap. It can visually track an [entity](LuaGuiElement::entity) that is set after the element has been created.\n- `\"entity-preview\"`: A preview of an entity. The [entity](LuaGuiElement::entity) has to be set after the element has been created.\n- `\"empty-widget\"`: An empty element that just exists. The root GUI elements `screen` and `relative` are `empty-widget`s.\n- `\"tabbed-pane\"`: A collection of `tab`s and their contents. Relevant event: [on_gui_selected_tab_changed](on_gui_selected_tab_changed)\n- `\"tab\"`: A tab for use in a `tabbed-pane`.\n- `\"switch\"`: A switch with three possible states. Can have labels attached to either side. Relevant event: [on_gui_switch_state_changed](on_gui_switch_state_changed)\n\nEach GUI element allows access to its children by having them as attributes. Thus, one can use the `parent.child` syntax to refer to children. Lua also supports the `parent[\"child\"]` syntax to refer to the same element. This can be used in cases where the child has a name that isn't a valid Lua identifier.","examples":["This will add a label called `greeting` to the top flow.

Values either name a NamedNoiseExpression or can be literal numbers, stored as strings (e.g. `\"5\"`). All other controls can be overridden by a property expression names. Notable properties: \n- `moisture` - a value between 0 and 1 that determines whether a tile becomes sandy (low moisture) or grassy (high moisture).\n- `aux` - a value between 0 and 1 that determines whether low-moisture tiles become sand or red desert.\n- `temperature` - provides a value (vaguely representing degrees Celsius, varying between -20 and 50) that is used (together with moisture and aux) as part of tree and decorative placement.\n- `elevation` - tiles values less than zero become water. Cliffs are placed along certain contours according to [CliffPlacementSettings](CliffPlacementSettings).\n- `cliffiness` - determines whether (when >0.5) or not (when <0.5) a cliff will be placed at an otherwise suitable (according to [CliffPlacementSettings](CliffPlacementSettings)) location.\n- `enemy-base-intensity` - a number that is referenced by both `enemy-base-frequency` and `enemy-base-radius`. i.e. if this is overridden, enemy base frequency and size will both be affected and do something reasonable. By default, this expression returns a value proportional to distance from any starting point, clamped at about 7.\n- `enemy-base-frequency` - a number representing average number of enemy bases per tile for a region, by default in terms of `enemy-base-intensity`.\n- `enemy-base-radius` - a number representing the radius of an enemy base, if one were to be placed on the given tile, by default proportional to a constant plus `enemy-base-intensity`. Climate controls ('Moisture' and 'Terrain type' at the bottom of the Terrain tab in the map generator GUI) don't have their own dedicated structures in MapGenSettings. Instead, their values are stored as property expression overrides with long names: \n- `control-setting:moisture:frequency:multiplier` - frequency (inverse of scale) multiplier for moisture noise. Default is 1.\n- `control-setting:moisture:bias` - global bias for moisture (which normally varies between 0 and 1). Default is 0.\n- `control-setting:aux:frequency:multiplier` - frequency (inverse of scale) multiplier for aux (called 'terrain type' in the GUI) noise. Default is 1.\n- `control-setting:aux:bias` - global bias for aux/terrain type (which normally varies between 0 and 1). Default is 0. All other MapGenSettings feed into named noise expressions, and therefore placement can be overridden by including the name of a property in this dictionary.
