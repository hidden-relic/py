.. NOTE:: 

    On Python 2.7, all string parameters are treated as **unicode strings** for consistency with Python 3 and with the encoding of Factorio blueprint strings.
    However, setters should take byte strings as input and convert them to unicode automatically, so you *shouldn't* have to worry about it in most cases.
